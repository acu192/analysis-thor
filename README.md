## Dataset Hosted on [Data.world](https://data.world/datamil/world-war-ii-thor-data)

The THOR World War II dataset (and info about the dataset) is hosted on [this data.world repo](https://data.world/datamil/world-war-ii-thor-data). I contribute my finished work to that data.world repo, but I maintain my _working_ repo here in `git`.

Each Jupyter notebook below answers one or more questions about the THOR WWII dataset. Each notebook is self-contained and can be run (and read) top-to-bottom if you care about the details.
